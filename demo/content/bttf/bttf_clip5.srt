0
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,140
Einstein, Hey Einstein, where's the dot boy? Huh

1
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,910
doc

2
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,990
you made it? Yeah,

3
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,770
welcome to my latest experiment.

4
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,340
This is the big one, the one I've been waiting for all my life.

5
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,030
It's a DeLorean.

6
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,570
All your questions will be answered. Roll tape.

7
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,570
Never mind that. Never mind that now.

8
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:39,950
Alright, I'm ready.

9
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,210
Good evening,

10
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,450
I'm dr Emmett Brown. I'm standing in the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.

11
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,090
It's saturday morning october 26th, 1985 1:18 a.m.

12
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,030
And this is temporal experiment number one,

13
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,990
come on honey. Hey boy, get in there

14
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,760
boy

15
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,730
put your seatbelt on,

16
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,730
That's it.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,480
Mhm.

18
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,300
Whoa, whoa

19
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,500
okay,

20
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,480
please note

21
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,880
that Einstein's clock is in precise synchronization with my control. Watch

22
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,540
got it right, check

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,230
good,

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,250
have a good trip Einstein.

25
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,460
Watch your head,

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,210
get that thing hooked up to the

27
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,240
car, watch this. Yeah, okay,

28
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,090
got it.

29
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,670
Got me the car. The car.

30
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,490
Yeah,

31
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,820
my calculations are correct.

32
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,330
When this baby hits 88 mph,

33
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,960
you're gonna see some serious shit,

34
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,130
what's this? What's this?

35
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,480
Oh

36
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,120
I tell you,

37
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,040
Miles

38
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,570
the temporal displacement occurred exactly. 1:20 a.m. And zero seconds,

39
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,899
jesus christ,

40
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,820
jesus christ doc, You disintegrated Einstein, calm down, marty,

41
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,210
I didn't disintegrate anything.

42
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,700
The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely attacked.

43
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,090
Where the hell are they? The appropriate question is when the hell are they?

44
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,470
You see Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler.

45
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I sent him

46
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,880
into the future,

47
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,000
One minute into the future to be exact

48
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,130
and precisely

49
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,830
1 21 am and zero seconds we shall catch up with him at the time received.

50
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,900
Wait a minute, wait a minute doc.

51
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,760
Are you telling me that you built a time machine

52
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,820
out of a DeLorean? The way I see it.

53
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,530
If you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it? Some style besides

54
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,230
the stainless steel construction made the flux dispersal

55
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,270
look out.

56
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,940
Why? What is it hot? It's cold,

57
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,680
cold.

58
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,560
I've started you little devil

59
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,590
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine and still ticking.

60
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,300
He's alright, he's fine and he's completely unaware that anything happened.

61
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,050
As far as he's concerned, the trip was instantaneous.

62
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,630
That's why his watch is exactly one minute behind mine.

63
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,800
He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time.

64
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,450
Come here,

65
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,020
I'll show you how it works.

66
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,290
First

67
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,440
you turn the time circuits on

68
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,160
this readout tells you where you're going. This one tells you where you are.

69
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
This one tells you where you were. You input your destination time on this keypad.

70
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,590
Say you want to see the sign of the declaration of independence

71
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,300
or witness the birth of christ.

72
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,090
Here's A Red Letter Date

73
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,460
in the History of Science November 5, 1955.

74
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,620
Yes of course, November 5, 1955.

75
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,520
What? I don't get what happened.

76
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,280
That was the day I invented time travel.

77
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,220
I remember it vividly,

78
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,700
I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porcelain was wet.

79
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,330
I slipped. Hit my head on the edge of the sink and when I came to I had a revelation.

80
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,380
A vision.

81
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,950
A picture in my head.

82
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,410
A picture of this.

83
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,440
This is what makes time travel possible

84
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,470
Flux, capacitor,

85
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,860
flux capacitor has taken me almost 30 years of my

86
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,440
entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day.

87
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,410
God, has it been that long?

88
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,200
Things have certainly changed around here.

89
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,540
I remember when this was all farmland, as far as the eye could see

90
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,740
old man peabody

91
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,190
on all of this.

92
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,700
He had this crazy idea

93
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,200
about breeding pine trees.

94
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,400
This is uh, this is heavy duty doc. This is great.

95
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,210
Does it run like on regular unleaded gasoline? Unfortunately.

96
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,110
No, it requires something with a little more kick plutonium

97
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,250
plutonium. Wait a minute. Are

98
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,120
you telling me that? This sucker is nuclear?

99
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,010
Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, no.

100
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,110
This sucker's electrical.

101
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,809
But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity.

102
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,620
I need doc. You don't just walk into a store and buy plutonium.

103
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,669
Did you rip that off?

104
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,680
Of course from a group of libyan nationalists.

105
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,990
They wanted me to build them a bomb.

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,750
So I took their plutonium and in turn gave them

107
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,280
a shiny bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts.

108
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,540
Come on, let's get you a radiation suit. We must prepare to reload

109
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,910
safe now. Everything's that line.

110
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't you lose those tapes now

111
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,060
record.

112
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,640
Almost got my lawyers,

113
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,470
who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future.

114
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm allergic to all synthetics in

115
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,740
the future.

116
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,520
Where you going? That's right. 25 years into the future.

117
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,270
I've always dreamed of seeing the future, looking beyond my years,

118
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,140
seeing the progress of mankind.

119
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,630
Why not?

120
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,910
I'll also be able to see who wins the next 25 world series.

121
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,260
Doc

122
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,900
look me up when you get there.

123
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,470
Indeed, I will

124
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,940
roll them.
