1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,040
so i'm going to go through the process

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,640
of importing videos from outside of mux

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,880
and expression engine

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,559
and get them into

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,400
both mugs and express engine as new

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,080
entries and new videos so to do that

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,960
we're going to use a add-on called data

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,800
grab

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,720
it's a third party add-on you can buy

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,920
from the expression engine store

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,640
it allows csvs json wordpress and other

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,359
things to be imported as entries

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,920
and i've got a test csv file i've

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,439
created it has the columns that we're

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
going to match up to the custom fields

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,040
like title the status uh description and

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,079
then the important one is urls and these

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,800
are both urls from multiple uh locations

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,440
like s3 and like my private server as

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,559
well as a mux id that already exists in

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,480
mux

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,960
so let's go ahead and map those i've put

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,520
the csv file on my server already to

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,600
import i'm going to hit create new csv

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,760
and i'm going to tell it that this is a

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,039
test.csv

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,840
and everything else is the same we're

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,840
going to put this in the events channel

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,240
it's going to read that csv sees the

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,640
columns so we're good so far

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,799
now we need to map the columns to

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,520
the fields in our expression engine

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,960
channel so title should be title

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,119
uh page content is going to be

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,640
description the important one here is

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,520
the mux assets is our url column

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,360
and then actually for status let's just

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,520
let's do status is

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,360
closed we're just that way we can find

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,840
them a lot easier so i'm going to hit

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,720
save this will create that we need to

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,920
test import

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,439
save

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,680
and now we've got that now the first

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,320
thing we need to do is run it and this

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,720
will create the entries and also push

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,560
the videos to mux and we'll get web

48
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,920
hooks and we'll see all of this

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,920
happening so i'm going to hit go

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,759
cool now it's complete i'm gonna go to

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,520
my channels hit refresh

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,600
and we should now see these closed

53
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,759
entries are all the new entries so if i

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,879
go to like a big clip which was a really

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,560
big clip that's going to take a little

56
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,840
while to import

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,720
we're going to see that it's in the

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,599
preparing status now if i go over to the

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,520
mux console we have nine new events that

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,840
were just triggered this was the

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,280
importing of those video files as new

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,680
assets

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,440
as they import i go to some of the other

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,560
ones like one might be really quick this

65
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,200
one should already be done because it's

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,200
already in mux we can see that it is

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,120
we can also see like music should be

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,640
done

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,239
and

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,640
uh there it is we're just waiting on the

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,879
files to upload and if we go to that big

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,840
clip we're really just waiting for

73
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,000
the video to finish importing and then

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,200
it will show up there so that's how you

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,879
can import a large number of videos into

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,400
mux and expression engine at the same

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
time whether that those videos are

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,000
already in mux

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,159
as ids or as

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,159
urls on a another

81
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,159
service
